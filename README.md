# Item Drop for Minetest/Minetest-C55

Original by PilzAdam

This mod adds Minecraft like drop/pick up of items to Minetest.

## Configuration

By default two behaviours are added:

1. Digging nodes causes them to drop rather than be systematically added to inventory
2. Standing near nodes causes them to be added to your inventory

You can turn them off with the following `mintest.conf` settings:

* `item_drop.autocollect = false` - turn off collecting nodes automatically
* `item_drop.drop_nodes = false` - turn off making nodes drop on dig
